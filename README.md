# DEA-with-Deseq2
This repository contains a collection of bulk RNA-seq differential expression analysis (DEA) workflows using DESeq2 in R, including practical examples and real datasets.

üìÅ Folder Overview

general_workflow/
Contains code and output from practice sessions based on the Udemy course
"Bioinformatic: Learn Bulk RNA-Seq Data Analysis From Scratch".
Covers basic DESeq2 workflow and visualizations.

case1/
Focuses on data preprocessing, especially summing of technical replicates.
Based on raw read count and metadata files from GSE283950 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE283950).

case2/
Demonstrates practice with contrasts and generation of visualizations (e.g., PCA, volcano plots).
Based on small RNA-seq data from GSE175657 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE175657).

case3/
Concentrated on GO enrichment and KEGG analysis as well as semantic similarity of GO terms. The data is from GSE51403 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE51403&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
